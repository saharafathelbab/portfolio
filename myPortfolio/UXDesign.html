      <p> For this stage, we had to think of questions to ask interviewees centeralizing on the routes they take to make friends.
        After interviewing 3 students at Montclair State University, we then proceeded to find patterns in their responses to the questions we asked. </p>

    <p> The goal was to find 5 websites and/or applications and select a 'Big Idea' from each
      that we thought would be useful to solving our solution. In the PDF, there are slides dedicated to explaining how the
        'Big Idea' worked in the application/website as well as Pros & Cons of applying the 'Big Idea' to our application. </p>

    <strong><a class = "links" href = "Conveying Your Solution.pdf"> Conveying the Solution [PDF] </a></strong>
    <p> We took our <a href = "Persona1.pdf"> Persona #1, Mason Cooper, </a> and developed a Context Scenerio.
       In the Context Scenerio, we explained a scenerio in which he would use the CollegeVibes application to make a friend.
     A storyboard is included as well for Persona #1. </p>

    <strong><a class = "links" href = "https://9te13l.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home"> Testing and Refining Our Solution [AXURE] </a></strong>
    <p> We used the program Axure to create a Key Path Scenerio angled specifically to an actual student at Montclair State University.
        After interviewing the student beforehand, we were able to create a version of CollegeVibes tailored to her interests. Below is a video of
        the student using the application. </p>

    <p>In this video, a fellow teammate - Sarah Fathelbab - is using the Think Aloud Protocol. We test the main features of the CollegeVibes application
       and how the student interacted with the application as a whole.</p>
