          My team and I developed a restaurant website, Take Me to Thailand, which allowed customers to view the items on the menu and place an order accordingly.
          The customer had to have a valid login which was encrypted in the database for security purposes.
          Upon logging in, the customer was able to view the PDF form of the menu before making the decision to begin their order and to select if they would like to dine in or takeout.
          A teammate and I were tasked with creating four views: <i>Employee, Customer, Owner, Manager </i> where the login info entered would direct them to the page(s) they were allowed to access.
