        <h4 class = "sum"> A friend of mine struggled to be consistent with working out
                          at the Montclair State University (MSU) Recreational Center due to a
                          hectic schedule as well as with incorporating healthy meals in her daily life.
                          As a result, I decided to compose a place where she will be able to follow along
                          with a YouTube Personal Trainer for short workouts and select easy to make healthy
                          recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. As more of an add-on,
                          I included a page of suggested videos to watch as well as books
                          and articles to read, based on her interests, to emphasize the
                          importance of Recovery Days.

                                       that correlated with her response.
