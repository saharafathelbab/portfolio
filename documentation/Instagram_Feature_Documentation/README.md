#### General Information

When Instagram users select a profile, while on their main feed, to scroll through, they may forget that they are not
on the main feed and scroll endlessly on a profile by accident. This feature alerts users they are not on their main feed.

#### Technologies Used

* Adobe XD

#### Why did you create this project?

After chatting with a friend on Twitter about the inevitiable liking of photos from months previous due to
forgetting to return to the main feed after selecting a profile to look at, this idea sprang to mind.

</p>

The idea is that when a user clicks on a profile from their main feed, a small profile circle appears on the home button
so the user is reminded they are in essence on an extension from their main feed viewing a profile. To ensure the user doesn't
forget they are scrolling on a profile they came to from the main feed, the small profile circle provides the reminder.

When users click on the home button, the return back to the spot they were on the main feed before selecting to view
a profile in depth.
