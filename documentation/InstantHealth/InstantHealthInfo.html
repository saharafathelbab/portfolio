        <b> Problem: </b>  Patients are not able to remember when was the last time they had a dental cleaning when
        they switch dentists or when they last had blood work done when they switch doctors.

        <b> Instant Health Solution: </b> Instant Health allows for patients to view their Health History at any time. Primary
          Care Doctors, Dentists, ER Doctors etc. are also able to use Instant Health to view previous health
          related issues, pertinent to their field, of the patient they are seeing.

  <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Visualizing Our Solution </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      Our first step was to make a Wireframe of the flow for Instant Health. We knew there needed to be
      a Health Professional viewpoint to insert Patient Data into the database and a Patient viewpoint for
      Patients to view their Health History. To ensure both options were viewed on the homepage, we
      decided to create two buttons on the Home Page: Login As Patient & Login As Doctor.
    </p>
    <center>
      <img class = "gif" src = "./images/patientview.gif" alt = "patient viewpoint">
      <figcaption class = "para_caption"> Prototype created using Adobe XD </figcaption>
    </center>

    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      Above is the Prototype I created for the Patient viewpoint based on the wireframe we sketched.
      If the Patient already has an account set up, they just have to enter their email and password to
      access their Health History. If they do not have an account, they must enter the key provided to
      to them by their Primary Care Doctor, and their email and password they would like to associate
      their account with.
      <br>
      <br>
      As we were running short on time, we decided to forego making personas.
    </p>

    <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right">  What do Health Professionals see when they login? </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      When a Health Professional logs in, they are shown two options: Search for a specific patient or add
      a new patient. If a Primary Care Doctor were to search for a specific patient by last name, and they
      are the Primary Care Doctor for multiple members of the family, the list of family members will
      appear. The doctor will then select the patient’s file they would like to view.
      <br>
      <br>
      If they were add A New Patient an auto-generated key would be provided, and they would have to
      insert the Patient’s information into the system (i.e. First Name, Last Name, Address, Social Security Number,
      Insurance etc.). they must only able to see information that is relevant to their field
      - i.e. If a Doctor was are unable to see the dentist records of the patient.
    </p>

  <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> What happens if a Health Professional does not have an account? </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      If a Health Professional does not have an account they must register their practice with Instant
      Health and await an email confirmation that they have successfully been approved to create
      an account.
    </p>

    <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Can a Primary Care Doctor view a Patient’s Dentist History?</h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      No, the Health Professional is only able to see information that is relevant to their field. A Primary
      Care Doctor is only able to view a Patient’s past Medical history.
