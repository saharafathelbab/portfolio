      <!-- inspiration for ciphers  -->
      <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Researching Ciphers </h1>
        <p class = "para" id = "right">
          For inspiration for my cipher, I decided to look at ciphers used in the past.
          <a class = "link_for_crypt" href = "https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/secret/secret.html">
         Francis Bacon </a>
         created a substitution cipher where each letter was turned into 5 character groups.
          I decided to use this method of ciphering for individual Uppercase and Lowercase letters.
          <br>
          <br>
          I decided to use the author's name: <b>Liza Mundy </b> as a base.
          As shown below, for the letter A, I used the letter L (first letter in her first name)
          as a place holder for four characters and the fifth character is an M (first letter in her last name).
        </p>
    <center>
      <img class = "photo_notepad" src = "./images/Dictionarystart.JPG" alt = "first draft cipher">
    </center>

    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      After completing this, I realized how easy it would be for someone to
      essentially crack the cipher. In the book, it mentioned how WAVES
      - Navy [Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service] would look for
       patterns to decipher & decode ciphers and code.
       <br>
       <br>
      After realizing how easy it would be for someone to grasp the flow of the cipher
      and piece together which five character group stood for each letter,
      I decided to go back to the drawing board. I knew I wanted to continue using
      five characters for each letter, but I knew that in order for the cipher to be stronger
      and harder for someone without the codebook to decipher, I needed to fix
      the arrangement of what five characters equated to each letter.
      <br>
      <br>
      The <a class = "link_for_crypt" href = "https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/secret/secret.html">
         diagrammatic cipher</a> - <a class = "link_for_crypt" href = "http://crypto.interactive-maths.com/pigpen-cipher.html">
         Pigpen cipher </a> - caught my eye,
       and I decided to implement the diagrammatic cipher with my Fracis Bacon
       inspired cipher with a slight difference. I decided to use the diagonal effect
       and placed the five character groups in 5 rows. Then I would list the letter the
       five character group would be assigned to in diagonal format.
      After completing this diagonal format for all 26 letters,
      I then decided to add another minor change to my cipher to include spaces in between the letters.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the end, lowercase and uppercase letters had a unique cipher each.

    <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right">  Researching Codes </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
    For the code for Words, Phrases, Special Characters and Numbers, I decided to
    first look at Telegraphic Codes. I looked at

     <a class = "link_for_crypt" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_code_(communications)">
      Commerical code (communications)</a>,

      <a class = "link_for_crypt" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_railway_telegraphic_codes">
        Australian Railway Telegraphic Codes </a>

       and

       <a class = "link_for_crypt" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway_telegraphic_codes">
          Great Westen Railway Telegraphic Codes </a>

          .
    Since cable tolls were charged by the word, phrases and words became small code groups
     and thus saved a lot of people money. Below is an example of a
     <a class = "link_for_crypt" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_code_(communications)">
          1910 radiator catalog: </a>

      <img class = "photo_notepad" src = "./images/telegraphcode.jpg" alt = "telegraphic code">
    </center>

    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      In the Australian Railway Telegraphic Codes and Great Western Railway Telegraphic codes large phrases were shortened into code groups.
      <br>
      <br>
      <a class = "link_for_crypt" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway_telegraphic_codes">
        For example: </a>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Boyne </b> – There is no water at the following station. Instruct drivers.
      <br>
      <br>
      I then began to search for a telegraphic book to learn more about how coding
      worked for each phrase. I found the

      <a class = "link_for_crypt" href = "https://archive.org/details/unicodeuniversa00unkngoog">
          1889 "Unicode".: The Universal Telegraphic Phrase-book </a>.

      From there, as I flipped through the pages, I discovered that the first began with the
      two letters Ab(other letters) and the next section after that was Ac(other letters)
      and so forth:

  <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> What does my code look like? </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      For my code for Words, Phrases, Numbers and Special Characters
      I decided to adopt the same technique described above.
      My codebook, after the ciphered letters, is divided into sections of frequent 2 letter words,
      4 letter words, questions etc.
    </p>

    <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Why is your codebook in its entirety not available for viewing?</h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      Well, wouldn't that defeat the purpose? I want you - however you landed here, welcome! - to try and break my code and cipher system just as the WAVES [Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service]
      broke the German's code & cipher system. The author said to me, when she discovered my cryptography project, many will try to break
      the code & cipher system. And to that I say, good luck & enjoy the challenge!
