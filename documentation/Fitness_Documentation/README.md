#### General Information

The aim of this Fitness Project is to be a resource where my friend will
be able to follow along with a YouTube Personal Trainer for short workouts and select easy
to make healthy recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
<br>
As more of an add-on, I included a page of suggested videos to watch as well
as books and articles to read, based on her interests, to emphasize the importance of Recovery Days.

#### Technologies Used

* HTML & CSS

#### Special Note:

After completing this project for my one friend, three other friends
also found the idea of it brilliant and currently use this to maintain a healthy diet and workout schedule.
