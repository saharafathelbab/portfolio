              a YouTube Personal Trainer for short workouts and select easy

              As more of an add-on, I included a page of suggested videos

              based on her interests, to emphasize the importance of
              Recovery Days.

        <b> Fitness: Workouts & Nutrition Project Solution: </b>
        This Fitness: Workouts & Nutrition Project provides
        my friend with a selection of workouts from a Personal Trainer
        that vary in times to fit in her hectic schecule,
        a selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner ideas, and a collection of Bloggers &
        YouTubers I currated for her based on her interests.

        <i> I would like to note that I am currently redesigning & developing this project.
        I created this project in January 2018 and I have grown since then and would
        like to provide my friend with a refined version.</i>

    <!-- difference between code and cipher -->
  <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> How did you decide on what workout videos to include? </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
    My first question for my friend was: <i> What area of your body would you like the workout the most? </i>
    <br>
    <br>
    She responded that she wanted to tone her arms and legs. From there, I decided what workout videos to include
    from the Personal Trainer on Youtube, Lucy Wyndham-Read.

    <!-- prototype or no? -->
    <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Did you prototype your pages before coding? </h1>
      <p class = "para" id = "right">
        At this point in my coding journey, January 2018, I was not introduced to the idea of prototyping.
        I created sketches in my notepad, which I later learned was referred to as Wireframing, of how I wanted
        the pages to look like.
        <br>
        <br>
        A couple of those sketches are below.

      <!-- sketches of pages -->
      <div class = "sketches-note">

                <figcaption class = "para_caption_persona"> Home Page </figcaption>

      </div>

      <!-- inspiration for ciphers  -->
      <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> What is a Recovery Day? </h1>
        <p class = "para" id = "right">
          A recovery day is a day for your body to rest. Working out is important, and
          allowing your body to recover is just as important.
          <br>
          <br>
          For this page, the general idea was to have a collection of suggested
          articles and videos for the user to watch. After asking my friend what
          she preferred to watch and read in her free time, I selected articles,
           books and YouTube videos that correlated with her response.
