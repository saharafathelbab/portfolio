          Code Girls.</a> After finishing the book in early December 2017,
        in January 2018 I decided to try my hand at creating a Code & Cipher.

      <h1 class = "toptitle"> BEHIND THE CODEBOOK </h1>

    <h4 class = "toptitle"> While debating on what type of Code Book I wanted
                            to create, it was
                            important for me to learn the
                            difference between a Code and
                            a Cipher. In the book Code Girls,
                            the author elaborated the differences.
                            <br><br>
                            To keep the differences in mind,
                            I decided to write it in my notepad.

    </h4>

    <img class = "cryptoimage" src = "Images/difference.JPG" alt = "difference between code & cipher">

    <h4 class = "toptitle">
      After writing down the difference between a Code and Cipher,
      I began to write my functional requirements. For each letter,
      Lowercase and Uppercase, I wanted for it to be ciphered.
      For words, phrases, Special Characters, and Numbers , I wanted for that to be coded.
    </h4>


    <h4 class = "toptitle">

      For inspiration for my cipher, I decided to look at ciphers used in the past.
      <a class = "link" href = "https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/secret/secret.html">
         Francis Bacon </a>

      created a substitution cipher where each letter was turned
      into 5 character groups. I decided to use this method of ciphering for individual
      Uppercase and Lowercase letters.
      <br>
      <br>
      I decided to use the authors name: Liza Mundy as a base. As shown below,
      for the letter A, I used the letter L (first letter in her first name) as a place holder
      for four characters and the fifth character is an M (first letter in her last name).

      <br>
      <br>

    </h4>

      <img class = "cryptoimage" src = "Images/Dictionarystart.JPG" alt = "start of the dictionary">

    <h4 class = "toptitle">
      After completing this, I realized how easy it would be for someone
      to essentially crack the cipher. In the book, it mentioned how WAVES - Navy
      [Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service] would look for patterns
      to decipher & decode ciphers and code.

      <br>
      <br>

      After realizing how easy it would be for someone to grasp the flow
      of the cipher and piece together which five character group stood
      for each letter, I decided to go back to the drawing board. I knew
      I wanted to continue using the five characters for each letter, but
      I knew that in order for the cipher to be stronger and harder
      for someone without the codebook to decipher, I needed to fix the arrangement
      of what five characters equated to each letter.

      <br>
      <br>

      The
      <a class = "link" href = "https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/secret/secret.html">
         diagrammatic cipher</a>
      -
      <a class = "link" href = "http://crypto.interactive-maths.com/pigpen-cipher.html">
         Pigpen cipher </a>

      - caught my eye, and I decided to implement
      the diagrammatic cipher with my Fracis Bacon inspired cipher with a
      slight difference.

      I decided to use the diagonal effect and placed the five character groups in 5 rows.
      Then I would list the letter the five character group would be assigned to in
      diagonal format.
    </h4>


    <h4 class = "toptitle">

      After completing this diagonal format for all 26 letters, I then decided to
      add another minor change to my cipher. As they are in groups of 5, I decided
      that for the letter a after 2 charaters there would be a space and after the
      letter b there would be a space after 3 letters and so forth.

      <img class = "lucase" src = "Images/lowecaseletterdic.png" alt = "lowercase letters">
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4 class = "toptitle">
      For Capital letters, I used the same 5 characters but added the character 0.
      So now each Uppercase letter has 6 characters. For example, the lowercase letter a is LL LLM
      and the uppercase letter A is LLL 0LM.

    <h4> _____ </h4>

    <h4 class = "toptitle">
      For the code for Words, Phrases, Special Characters and Numbers, I decided
      to first look at Telegraphic Codes. I looked at
      <a class = "link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_code_(communications)">
         Commerical code (communications)</a>
       ,
       <a class = "link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_railway_telegraphic_codes">
          Australian Railway Telegraphic Codes </a>
          and
      <a class = "link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway_telegraphic_codes">
          Great Westen Railway Telegraphic Codes </a>
       .
       Since cable tolls were charged by the word, phrases and words became small code groups
       and thus saved a lot of people money. Below is an example of a
      <a class = "link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_code_(communications)">
          1910 radiator catalog: </a>
          <br>
          <br>

      <img class = "telegraphimage" src = "Images/telegraphcode.jpg" alt = "telegraph code 1910">
    </h4>

    <h4 class = "toptitle">
      In the Australian Railway Telegraphic Codes and Great Western
      Railway Telegraphic codes large phrases were shortened into code groups.
      <a class = "link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway_telegraphic_codes">
          For example: </a>
      <br>
      <br>

       Boyne â€“ There is no water at the following station. Instruct drivers.
    </h4>

    <h4 class = "toptitle">
      I then began to search for a telegraphic book to learn more about how
        coding worked for each phrase. I found the
        <a class = "link" href = "https://archive.org/details/unicodeuniversa00unkngoog">
          1889 "Unicode".: The Universal Telegraphic Phrase-book </a>.
          From there, as I flipped through the pages, I discovered that the first
            began with the two letters Ab(other letters) and the next section after that
            was Ac(other letters) and so forth:
            <br>
      </h4>

        <img class = "codebook" src = "Images/codebooktelegraph.png" alt = "Telegraphic Phrase Book">


    <h4 class = "toptitle">
      For my code for Words, Phrases, Numbers and Special Characters I decided
      to adopt the same technique. My codebook, after the ciphered letters,
       is divided into sections of frequent 2 letter words, 4 letter words, questions etc.
       <br>
       <br>

       For the Frequent 2 letter words, I started with the two letters AB and proceeded to
       use the same method (AC, AD etc.).
       <br>
       <br>

       Below, is the section of Frequent 2 Letter Words from my Code Book:
