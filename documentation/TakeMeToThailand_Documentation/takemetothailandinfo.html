        <b> Problem: </b>  Customers were only able to view
         and order from the menu at the restaurant. This meant
         that if a customer wanted to order a Take Out,
         they would have to place the order in person
         and wait the designated time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Take Me to Thailand Solution: </b> This web application
          allows for customers to view the menu online and to place
          an order specifying whether or not they would like to dine in
          or take out their meal.
