        <b> Problem: </b>  First year non transfer commuter students find it
        difficult to utilize their pockets of free time throughout
        the day to their advantage to meet and make friends with
        their classmates.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> CollegeVibes Solution: </b> CollegeVibes is a social media platform that allows for students to utilize their pockets
        of free time to befriend classmates, start a conversation with an Icebreaker if they are unsure how to initiate
        the conversation, and view real-time statuses made.

  <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Interview Stage </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      For this stage, we had to think of questions to ask interviewees
      centeralizing on the routes they take to make friends. After
      interviewing 3 students at Montclair State University,
      we then proceeded to find patterns in their responses to
      the questions we asked:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol id = "right">
        <li class = "para" id = "right">
          Everyone has this in common: Would like to have that chance to make
          friends but there isnâ€™t that leisure of time. (i.e. full time student, full
          time/part time job, or taking care of children)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class = "para" id = "right">
          Two of the interviewees had this in common: Use social media on a daily to
          keep up with friends.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class = "para" id = "right">
          Two of the interviewees had this in common: Go to class, and then leave to
          immediately get started on the assignment given. They would make a
          friend in class only if they HAD to. (i.e. group project)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class = "para" id = "right">
          Everyone had this in common: Met their closest friends in person not
          through social media online.

      The goal was to find 5 websites and/or applications

      be useful to our CollgeVibes solution. In the PDF below, there are
      slides dedicated to explaining how the 'Big Idea' worked
      in the application/website as well as Pros & Cons of applying
      the 'Big Idea' to our application.
      <br>
      <br>
      The 5 websites and/or apps we selected were: Tinder, ASOS, Instagram, LinkedIn, Canvas.

      Yes, we tailored the application to show a student's interests and used the Think Aloud Protocol.

      We test the main features of the CollegeVibes application and how the student interacted with the application as a whole.

      The College Vibes Prototype provided below is the prototype that was tailored towards this specific student.
