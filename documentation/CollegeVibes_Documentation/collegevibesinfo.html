        <b> Problem: </b>  First year non transfer commuter students find it
        difficult to utilize their pockets of free time throughout
        the day to their advantage to meet and make friends with
        their classmates.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> CollegeVibes Solution: </b> CollegeVibes is a social media platform that allows for students to utilize their pockets
        of free time to befriend classmates, start a conversation with an Icebreaker if they are unsure how to initiate
        the conversation, and view real-time statuses made.

  <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Interview Stage </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      For this stage, we had to think of questions to ask interviewees
      centeralizing on the routes they take to make friends. After
      interviewing 3 students at Montclair State University,
      we then proceeded to find patterns in their responses to
      the questions we asked:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol id = "right">
        <li class = "para" id = "right">
          Everyone has this in common: Would like to have that chance to make
          friends but there isn’t that leisure of time. (i.e. full time student, full
          time/part time job, or taking care of children)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class = "para" id = "right">
          Two of the interviewees had this in common: Use social media on a daily to
          keep up with friends.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class = "para" id = "right">
          Two of the interviewees had this in common: Go to class, and then leave to
          immediately get started on the assignment given. They would make a
          friend in class only if they HAD to. (i.e. group project)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class = "para" id = "right">
          Everyone had this in common: Met their closest friends in person not
          through social media online.

      The goal was to find 5 websites and/or applications
      and select a 'Big Idea' from each that we thought would
      be useful to our CollgeVibes solution. In the PDF below, there are
      slides dedicated to explaining how the 'Big Idea' worked
      in the application/website as well as Pros & Cons of applying
      the 'Big Idea' to our application.
      <br>
      <br>
      The 5 websites and/or apps we selected were: Tinder, ASOS, Instagram, LinkedIn, Canvas.

    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      Yes, we tailored the application to show a student's interests and used the Think Aloud Protocol.
      In <a class = "link_pdf_color" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr4zV6xKlZI"> this YouTube video, </a> a fellow teammate - Sarah Fathelbab - is using the Think Aloud Protocol.
      We test the main features of the CollegeVibes application and how the student interacted with the application as a whole.

      The College Vibes Prototype provided below is the prototype that was tailored towards this specific student.
