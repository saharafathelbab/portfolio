              As I grew as a Designer & Front-End Developer,
              my previous portfolio design no longer reflected
              my skill-set. So, I decided to redesign & code
              my portfolio to better reflect who I am.

        What was the problem with the old design and how does this portfolio design solve it?

      <p class = "para" id = "right">
        <b> Problem: </b>  The old design was not mobile friendly, did not provide
        a description of my projects prior to viewing it in its entirety or a well
        structured About Me and was overall not visibly pleasing to view.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> New Design Solution: </b> This Portfolio design allows for whomever is
        viewing it the ability to view it on their mobile device or laptop, shows
        a brief elevator pitch of each project presented prior to viewing it
        in its entirety, has a concise About Me, and synonymous typography
        and design throughout.

    <!-- visualizing my solution -->
  <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right">Did you jump straight to prototyping your design? </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      Prior to designing, I ensured that I had pre written what would be
      showcased on my portfolio i.e. My About Me page and elevator pitches
      for each project.
    </p>

  <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Did you create a High Fidelity Prototype for both Mobile & Desktop? </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
        I used ADOBE XD to create a High Fidelity Prototype for Desktop and a Low Fidelity Prototype for
        mobile. Below is the Desktop Prototype.

      <p class = "para" id = "right">
        The journey of how I ended up with the final design of the homepage is best described through <a class =
        "link_for_port" href = "https://twitter.com/SaharasDreams/status/1049791690800795648"> a twitter
        thread I wrote as I was designing it. </a> When I first began sketching
        the design, I knew I wanted words that best describe me to be
        front and center on the home page.
        I began my design process by showcasing my interests in different movie posters, realized that
        it did not at all look like the aesthetic blessing I thought it would look
        like, and ended with me creating icons for the words that describe me:
        5000M Runner, Front-End Developer, UX/UI Designer, and Blogger.

      <!-- Differences -->
      <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> What's the difference between the homepage for mobile and desktop?</h1>
        <p class = "para" id = "right">
          <b> Background Image: </b> For Desktop viewing, it is
          a landscape photo of a keyboard, pen, and a cup of tea being shown. For mobile viewing it is a vertical image of a plant.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b> Navigation: </b> On desktop, the navigation bar has my name on the
          top left corner and the links to my Projects, About Me, Blog, and Youtube
          Channel are spread out on the right hand side. On mobile, my
          name remains on the top left corner however the links are encompassed
          in a drop down menu.

    <!-- the about me page -->
    <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> About Me Page </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
     I opted for a simple design for this page where on Desktop the text would
     be on the lefthand side and on the righthand side would be a photo of me.
     I decided to include socials,
      <a class = "link_for_port" href = "https://twitter.com/SaharasDreams"> LinkedIn </a>
    ,
      <a class = "link_for_port" href = "https://twitter.com/SaharasDreams"> Twitter </a>
    ,
      <a class = "link_for_port" href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/saharasdreams"> Youtube </a>
      and
      <a class = "link_for_port" href= "mailto:saharafathelbab1@gmail.com"> my Email </a>

     below my photo for easy access.
     <br>
     <br>
     On Mobile, my photo with my socials beneath are at the top of the page
     and the text is underneath.

    </center>

    <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> What is the purpose of the 'Free Time' being included? </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
    I decided to create a small section in my About Me
    providing how I spend my free time to show a more fuller picture
    of who I am as a person. Although I am a Developer, I am also an athlete
    training for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics as a 5000M Runner, a
    <a class = "link_for_port" href = "http://saharas-dreams.blogspot.com/"> Blogger </a>, and
    <a class = "link_for_port" href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/saharasdreams"> Youtuber. </a>
    In addition to that I am also one half of the <a class = "link_for_port" href = "https://www.instagram.com/codingsisters/"> CodingCisters Instagram account </a> in which
    my sister and I advocate for women to take the tech plunge.
    </p>

  <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Projects Page </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      One thing that was important to me was to have a small blurb/elevator pitch
      for each project prior to someone viewing the project in its entirety.
      Without an elevator pitch a person would not know what exactly they
      are clicking on.
      <br>
      <br>
      I decided to also have two buttons: View Documentation & View Project.
    </p>

    <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> What's the difference between the Project Page for mobile and desktop?</h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      On Desktop, the user should be able to see an image relating to the project on the lefthand
      side and it's accompanying elevator pitch on the righthand side. Below the elevator pitch
      there are the two buttons: View Documentation & View Project.
      <br>
      <br>
      On mobile, the image relating to the project is above the elevator pitch and buttons.

    </center>

    <h1 class = "heading_lead_smaller" id = "right"> Documentation Page </h1>
    <p class = "para" id = "right">
      My aim with the Documentation Page was to present the problem that my project solves
      & how it solves it and automatically give the option to view the project after
      reading that briefly.
      <br>
      <br>
      If someone would like to view the in depth research & documentation that accompanies
      the project, they are able to press the down bar. The reason I made it optional to
      view the entire detailed documentation was because a recruiter/employer only has
      a couple of minutes to glance at a portfolio. The aim was for a recruiter/employers to
      understand the gist of the project instantly.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Desktop & Mobile version are identical.
